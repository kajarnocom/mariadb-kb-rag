Searching for 5 closest chunks to: 'replication'

Prompting LLM with 5 chunks and question: 'replication'

Response from LLM:
Replication in MariaDB can be achieved using Galera replication, which provides a virtually synchronous replication environment. Here are some key features of Galera replication:

- **Active-active multi-primary topology**: You can read and write to any cluster node without having to designate a master.
- **Automatic membership control**: Failed nodes are automatically dropped from the cluster, ensuring that the cluster remains operational with minimal manual intervention.
- **Automatic node joining**: New nodes can join the cluster seamlessly without complex configurations.
- **True parallel replication on row level**: This allows for more efficient processing of transactions.
- **No replica lag**: Transactions are applied nearly instantaneously across all nodes, preventing delays commonly associated with traditional asynchronous replication.
- **No lost transactions**: Transactions are guaranteed to be replicated without loss.
- **Read scalability**: Query operations can be distributed across multiple nodes, improving overall performance.
- **Smaller client latencies**: Direct client connections contribute to reduced response times.

For more detailed information, you can refer to the [About Galera Replication](https://kb.en/about-galera-replication/) article.

Searching for 5 closest chunks to: 'create vector index'

Prompting LLM with 5 chunks and question: 'create vector index'

Response from LLM:
To create a vector index in MariaDB, you can define it within the `CREATE TABLE` statement using the `VECTOR INDEX` syntax. Here’s an example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE v (
   id INT PRIMARY KEY,
   v VECTOR(5) NOT NULL,
   VECTOR INDEX (v)
);
```

This creates a table named `v` with a column `v` defined as a vector of size 5 and creates a vector index on that column. Note that the `CREATE VECTOR INDEX` statement is not fully implemented yet, so defining the index this way within the `CREATE TABLE` statement should be used for now.

Searching for 5 closest chunks to: 'where can MariaDB Galera Cluster be downloaded?'

Prompting LLM with 5 chunks and question: 'where can MariaDB Galera Cluster be downloaded?'

Response from LLM:
MariaDB Galera Cluster can be obtained by installing the standard MariaDB Server packages along with the [Galera wsrep provider library](https://github.com/codership/galera/) package. If you prefer using package managers, the package is called `galera` for installation via [yum](https://kb.en/yum/), [apt](https://kb.en/installing-mariadb-deb-files/#installing-mariadb-with-apt), or [zypper](https://kb.en/installing-mariadb-with-zypper/). For detailed instructions on getting started with MariaDB Galera Cluster, you can refer to the [Getting Started with MariaDB Galera Cluster](https://kb.en/getting-started-with-mariadb-galera-cluster/) page.

Searching for 5 closest chunks to: 'What data types should be used for vector data?'

Prompting LLM with 5 chunks and question: 'What data types should be used for vector data?'

Response from LLM:
For vector data in MariaDB, the recommended data type is `VECTOR`. This data type is designed to store vectors generated by AI models. In particular, vector columns store 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point numbers.

Here is an example of how to define a vector column in a `CREATE TABLE` statement:

```sql
CREATE TABLE v (
   id INT PRIMARY KEY,
   v VECTOR(5) NOT NULL,
   VECTOR INDEX (v)
);
```

In this example, `v` is a vector column capable of holding a vector of specified dimensions (in this case, 5).
